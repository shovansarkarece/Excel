RANK function is depricated that's why we use RANK.EQ()

Synatx:RANK(number,range;order)--&gt;By-default order is

always in descending order so don't touch in order

k45 is basically RANK 5 and K46 is RANK 6 because there

are no rank is in decimal number but in average for cell K45,RANK value is 5 and for cell K46 RANK value is 6.IF we add 5+6=11--&gt;RANK&gt;AVG(11/2)--&gt;5,5(That is the main point)

IN K column we are geting rank average 5,5 and rankÂ  5 ,two times which is bit conflicted that's why we use this New RANK formula with COUNTIF

**<mark>=RANK(G45;G45:G55)+COUNTIF($G$45:G45;G45)-1</mark>**
